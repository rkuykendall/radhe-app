              <p>This is an abridged clip from a talk I gave to about 1,000 Indian-American women, with age ranges from 14 to 75, at the annual BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir Women’s Conference at my local temple in Flushing, Queens. The theme of the conference was ‘life in resonance’ and I chose to talk to my fellow devotees about how our Hindu identities intersect with our professional lives and leadership positions, and how to use the dualism inherent in our lives to be better changemakers and leaders in our community more broadly. I ended with a call to action, urging participants to share the unique viewpoints and experiences we have to build mutual understanding, action-oriented coalitions and a general sense of pluralism in our communities. The full talk (about 12 minutes) can be found at the bottom of this webpage. </p>

            <p>I co-founded the Rikers Debate Project in the summer of 2016. In addition to teaching classes regularly, I have worn almost every hat (often at the same time) as part of our leadership team-- curriculum writer, director of external affairs, community partnership coordinator, and re-entry case manager to name a few. I have had the opportunity to help our program grow from one class on Rikers Island to 3 weekly classes on Rikers in different facilities, 1 community-based class in Queens, and two newly launched classes in Washington DC and Chicago.</p>

            <p>Women of Color for Progress is an organization that provides financial support to women of color candidates running in local elections, recruits women of color to take leadership roles in elected office, community boards, and county committees, and provides inclusive training and education opportunities around local issues. As a co-founder I focused on member recruitment, educational event planning, and developing a mentorship program for young (high school-aged) women of color in New York City.</p>

                <p>I left the Mayor’s Office in April of 2017 to spend the summer before law school focusing full time on three things: the Rikers Debate Project, Women of Color for Progress, and finding a way to contribute to engagement efforts around the South Asian community in particular.</p>

                <p>I had the opportunity to achieve the third objective by collaborating with Raj Goyle, an NYC-based donor and leader interested in this issue and focused on the Indian American community. He was working on developing an apparatus to focus on politically activating Indian American candidates, donors and communities. I synthesized research and presented ideas around political trends and models for increasing engagement. I attend trainings aimed at candidates and operatives, comparing and contrasting different programs with an eye on developing a training program specific to the challenges and opportunities Indian American candidates face (which will hopefully launch when the initial development of the project is further along).</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 2015, I collaborated with my peers in the Washington Leadership Program to start a social media campaign around what it means to be South Asian, called #SouthAsianAnd. We were interested in challenging the traditional narrative of what people imagined South Asian Americans to be, spotlight activists and leaders from the South Asian community, and provide an alternative story that could inspire younger South Asian Americans to become whatever they wanted to be in this country.</p>

                    <p>The summerlong campaign was so successful that we later partnered with an online magazine, national advocacy organizations, and partisan groups to launch a “#SouthAsianAnd The Election” spinoff during the 2016 Presidential Election, which focused on amplifying the views of our community members and discussing why they weren't always reflected in the mainstream. </p>
