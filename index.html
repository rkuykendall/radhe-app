              <p>This is an abridged clip from a talk I gave to about 1,000 Indian-American women, with age ranges from 14 to 75, at the annual BAPS Swaminarayan Temple Women’s Conference at my local temple in Flushing, Queens. The theme of the conference was ‘life in resonance’ and I chose to talk to my fellow devotees about how our Hindu identities intersect with our professional lives and leadership positions, and how to use the dualism inherent in our lives to be better changemakers and participants in our community more broadly. I ended with a call to action, urging participants to share the unique viewpoints and experiences we have to build mutual understanding, action coalitions and a general sense of pluralism in our communities.</p>

            <p>I co-founded the Rikers Debate Project in the summer of 2015. In addition to teaching classes regularly, I have worn almost every hat (often at the same time) as part of our leadership team-- curriculum writer, director of external affairs, community partnership coordinator, and re-entry case manager to name a few. I have had the opportunity to help our program grow from one class on Rikers Island to 3 weekly classes on Rikers in different facilities, 1 community-based class in Queens, and two newly launched classes in Washington DC and Chicago.</p>

            <p>Women of Color for Progress is an organization that provides financial support to women of color candidates running local elections, recruits local women to take leadership roles in elected office, community boards, and county committees, and provides inclusive training and education opportunities around local issues affecting communities. As a co-founder I focused on member recruitment, educational event planning, and developing a mentorship program for young women of color in New York City.</p>

                <p>I left the Mayor’s Office in April of 2017 to spend the summer before law school focusing full time on my efforts with the Rikers Debate Project, Women of Color for Progress, and to find a way to contribute to engagement efforts around the South Asian community in particular.</p>

                <p>I had the opportunity to spend much of that time collaborating with Raj Goyle, an NYC-based donor interested in this issue. He was working on developing an apparatus to focus on politically activating Indian American candidates, donors and communities. I helped synthesize relevant research, and I attend trainings for candidates and operatives. I compared and contrasted different programs with an eye on developing a training program specific to the challenges and opportunities Indian American candidates face, which will hopefully launch when the initial development of the project is further along.</p>

                    <p>In summer of 2015, I collaborated with my peers in the Washington Leadership Program to start a social media campaign around what it means to be South Asian, called #SouthAsianAnd. We were interested in challenging the traditional narrative of what people imagined South Asian Americans to be, spotlight activists and leaders from the South Asian community, and provide an alternative story that could inspire younger South Asian Americans to be whatever they wanted in this country.</p>

                    <p>The summerlong campaign was so successful, that we later partnered with Brown Girl Magazine, nonprofits, and partisan organizations to launch a “#SouthAsianAnd The Election” spinoff during the 2016 Presidential Election, which focused on amplifying the opinions of our community and discussing why it wasn't always reflected in the mainstream. </p>
